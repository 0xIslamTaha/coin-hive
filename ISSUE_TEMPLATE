READ THIS BEFORE SUBMITTING AN ISSUE!

Before you submit an issue, take into account that this project has NOTHING to do with coin-hive.com

This is just an npm package that launches a headless chromium and runs coin-hive.com javascript miner in it, 
so you can use it from node.js (otherwise it only works on the browser).

So if you have an issue with the javascript miner itself, or with coin-hive.com website, 
you should read their FAQs and contact them here:

Thanks for reading ^.^ if you DO have an issue with this package (found a bug, feature request) then PLEASE DO submit it :D
